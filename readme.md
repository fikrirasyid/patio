# Patio
### A beautiful photo-centric theme

> Photobloggers rejoice
> Or anyone who’s fond of featured image
> For a theme which presents your image beautifully

## The Origin
Patio is planned to be my fifth theme in the repository. It is designed and developed in March – April 2015. I planned to submit at least six themes in 2015. This is my third theme in 2015.

## The Goals
Patio is made with these goals in mind:

1. As [my other themes](http://fikrirasy.id/project-type/wordpress-themes/), it should “just works” and looks great on various screen size (responsive).
2. I want a different take on photo-centric / photoblog theme. Most themes went with square / pinterest-like approach. Patio should offer a different, fresh, and better approach.
3. Patio makes skimming content easy and fun. It should be a visual amusement.
4. It should work well with [WP-IG](http://fikrirasy.id/portfolio/wp-ig/), plugin for syncing your Instagram photos with your WordPress sites. I want to use Patio on my own blog and I use WP-IG.

## Plugin Compatibilities
Patio works nicely with these plugins:

1. [Jetpack](http://jetpack.me/)’s Infinite Scroll & Site Logo. If you have footer widgets, Infinite Scroll is automatically set to click-to-load mode. If you don’t have footer widgets, Infinite Scroll is automatically set to auto-load mode. It adapts with your site settings.
2. [Civil Footnotes](https://wordpress.org/plugins/civil-footnotes/)
3. [Subtitles](https://wordpress.org/plugins/subtitles/)
4. [WP-IG](http://fikrirasy.id/portfolio/wp-ig/)
